## Guiding an AI coding agent for hyperzoekt

Purpose: concise, actionable instructions to let an AI coding agent be productive here.

Quick rules
 - Always follow Rust best practices: prefer idiomatic ownership/borrowing, clear error handling (use `Result` and `anyhow`/`thiserror` where appropriate), prefer iterator adapters over manual loops, avoid unnecessary clones, and favor small, testable functions. Run `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings` locally before committing.

Architecture snapshot
 - Cargo workspace root: top-level `Cargo.toml` controls the workspace and `workspace.members`.
 - Entry: `src/main.rs` is the top-level binary prototype.
 - Indexing: `crates/hyperzoekt` contains the indexing service (public API: `RepoIndexService::build(root)` and `search(query)`). Keep the public API small and stable.

Developer workflows (commands)

	- `cargo fmt --all`
	- `cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings`

Removing files

	- Use `git rm <file>` to remove files from the working directory and stage the removal for commit.

Questions to ask the repo owner (if unclear)

Done â€” update this file if the workspace layout changes.

## Quick verification commands for SBOM tools

Run these commands inside the devcontainer to get clean, non-interactive output that avoids interactive shell hooks and PATH warnings:

```bash
# show which binary will be used and print a minimal version string
bash --noprofile --norc -c 'command -v cdxgen && env TERM=dumb cdxgen --version'
bash --noprofile --norc -c 'command -v depscan || command -v dep-scan && env TERM=dumb depscan --version || env TERM=dumb dep-scan --version'
```

If `depscan` is installed by `pipx` into a user-local location, ensure the Dockerfiles symlink it into `/usr/local/bin` so the wrappers can find `dep-scan` reliably.

We don't need to worry about backwards compatibility and we don't intend for interoperability with the upstream version of zoekt.

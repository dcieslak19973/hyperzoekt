#
# Recommended batch tuning
# - batch_capacity: how many entities to accumulate before flushing. Larger
#   values increase throughput but raise per-flush latency and risk creating
#   very large DB transactions. A good default is 500 which gives a small
#   number of medium-sized chunks for most repositories.
# - batch_timeout_ms: how long to wait (ms) before flushing a partially-
#   filled batch. Lower values improve responsiveness at the cost of more
#   DB calls. 100ms is a sensible default for interactive/continuous
#   streaming workloads.
#
# For one-time initial loads prefer `initial_batch` (chunked inline CREATEs)
# since it produced the lowest total import time in our experiments. For
# long-running streaming, either enable chunked streaming (so large flushes
# are split) or tune `batch_timeout_ms` down to avoid monolithic transactions.

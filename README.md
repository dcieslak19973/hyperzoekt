A Rust project exploring fast code search and semantic indexing by combining ideas from Sourcegraph's Zoekt (https://github.com/sourcegraph/zoekt) with a hypergraph-based code model.

Goals
-----
- Build a high-performance, trigram-backed code search engine inspired by Zoekt, implemented (in part) in Rust.
- Extract and reuse Tree-sitter tooling to produce rich syntactic and semantic information for source code.
- Store Tree-sitter results and repository metadata in a flexible hypergraph to enable advanced queries, permission-aware access, and cross-repo analysis.
- Provide usable interfaces: a command-line client and a simple web UI for searching and browsing index results.
- Support indexing multiple repository hosts (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) and syncing permission data for multi-user environments.

Roadmap (high level)
--------------------
1. Extract Tree-sitter integration and make it reusable across indexing workflows.
2. Design the hypergraph schema and prototype storing Tree-sitter/AST data.
3. Port core Zoekt indexing/search pieces and blend them with the hypergraph model.
4. Add multi-repo ingestion and permission syncing.
